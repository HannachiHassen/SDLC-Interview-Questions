# SDLC Interview Questions

## What is verification
Verification ensures the product is designed to deliver all functionality to the customer; it typically involves reviews and meetings to evaluate documents, plans, code, requirements, and specifications; this can be done with checklists, issues list, and walkthroughs and inspection meetings.

## What is Validation
Validation ensures that functionality, as defined in requirements, is the intended behavior of the product; validation typically involves actual testing and takes place after verifications are completed. 

## What is walkthrough
A walkthrough is an informal meeting for evaluation or informational purposes. A walkthrough is also a process at an abstract level. It's the process of inspecting software code by following paths through the code (as determined by input conditions and choices made along the way). The purpose of code walkthroughs is to ensure the code fits the purpose. Walkthroughs also offer opportunities to assess an individual's or team's competency. 

## What is Quality
Quality software is software that is reasonably bug-free, delivered on time and within budget, meets requirements and expectations and is maintainable

## What is good code? 
A good code is code that works, is free of bugs and is readable and maintainable. 

## What is good design? 
Design could mean to many things, but often refers to functional design or internal design. Good functional design is indicated by software functionality can be traced back to customer and end-user requirements. Good internal design is indicated by software code whose overall structure is clear, understandable, easily modifiable and maintainable; is robust with sufficient error handling and status logging capability; and works correctly when implemented. 

## What is software life cycle? 
Software life cycle begins when a software product is first conceived and ends when it is no longer in use. It includes phases like initial concept, requirements analysis, functional design, internal design, documentation planning, test planning, coding, document preparation, integration, testing, maintenance, updates, re-testing and phase-out.

## What is the role of documentation in QA
Documentation plays a critical role in QA. QA practices should be documented, so that they are repeatable. Specifications, designs, business rules, inspection reports, configurations, code changes, test plans, test cases, bug reports, user manuals should all be documented. Ideally, there should be a system for easily finding and obtaining of documents and determining what document will have a particular piece of information. Use documentation change management, if possible. 

## What about requirements
Requirement specifications are important and one of the most reliable methods of insuring problems in a complex software project is to have poorly documented requirement specifications. Requirements are the details describing an application's externally perceived functionality and properties. Requirements should be clear, complete, reasonably detailed, cohesive, attainable, and testable. 

## What is a test plan
A software project test plan is a document that describes the objectives, scope, approach and focus of a software testing effort. The process of preparing a test plan is a useful way to think through the efforts needed to validate the acceptability of a software product. The completed document will help people outside the test group understand the why and how of product validation. It should be thorough enough to be useful, but not so thorough that none outside the test group will be able to read it.

## What is a test case 
A test case is a document that describes an input, action, or event and its expected result, in order to determine if a feature of an application is working correctly. A test case should contain particulars such as a... 

•   Test case identifier
•   Test case name
•   Objective 
•   Input data requirements/steps 
•   Expected results. 
Please note, the process of developing test cases can help find problems in the requirements or design of an application, since it requires you to completely think through the operation of the application. For this reason, it is useful to prepare test cases early in the development cycle, if possible. 


## What is software quality assurance 
Software Quality Assurance is oriented to *prevention*. It involves the entire software development process. Prevention is monitoring and improving the process, making sure any agreed-upon standards and procedures are followed and ensuring problems are found and dealt with. 

## What is quality assurance 
Quality Assurance ensures all parties concerned with the project adhere to the process and procedures, standards and templates and test readiness reviews. A lot will depend on team leads or managers, feedback to developers and communications among customers, managers and testers.

## Standards and templates - what is supposed to be in a document 
All documents should be written to a certain standard and template. Standards and templates maintain document uniformity. It also helps in learning where information is located, making it easier for a user to find what they want. 

## What are the different levels of testing
Each level of testing is either considered black or white box testing. 

## What is black box testing
Black box testing is functional testing, not based on any knowledge of internal software design or code. Black box testing is based on requirements and functionality. 

## What is white box testing
White box testing is based on knowledge of the internal logic of an application's code. Typically done by developers.

## What is unit testing
Unit testing is the first level of dynamic testing and is first the responsibility of developers and then that of the test engineers. Unit testing is performed after the expected test results are met or differences are explainable/acceptable. 
 
## What is functional testing
Functional testing is black-box type of testing geared to functional requirements of an application. Test engineers *should* perform functional testing. 

## What is integration testing
Upon completion of unit testing, integration testing begins. Integration testing is black box testing. The purpose of integration testing is to ensure distinct components of the application still work in accordance with customer requirements. Test cases are developed with the express purpose of exercising the interfaces between the components. This activity is carried out by the test team. Integration testing is considered complete, when actual results and expected results are either in line or differences are explainable/acceptable based on client input.

## What is incremental integration testing 
Incremental integration testing is continuous testing of an application as new functionality is recommended. This may require that various aspects of an application's functionality are independent enough to work separately, before all parts of the program are completed, or that test drivers are developed as needed. This type of testing may be performed by programmers, software engineers, or test engineers.

## What is system testing
System testing is black box testing, performed by the Test Team, the purpose of system testing is to validate an application's accuracy and completeness in performing the functions as designed. System testing is deemed complete when actual results and expected results are either in line or differences are explainable or acceptable, based on client input. Upon completion of integration testing, system testing is started. 

## What is Gray Box testing
A style of testing that attempts to blend both “white box” and “black box” test strategies.

## What is end-to-end testing 
Similar to system testing, the *macro* end of the test scale is testing a complete application in a situation that mimics real world use, such as interacting with a database, using network communication, or interacting with other hardware, application, or system. 

## What is regression testing 
Regression testing is like retesting after fixing or modification. Expected results from are compared to results of the software under test

## What is sanity testing 
Sanity testing is performed whenever cursory testing is sufficient to prove the application is functioning according to specifications. This level of testing is a subset of regression testing. It normally includes a set of core tests of basic GUI functionality to demonstrate connectivity to the database, application servers, printers, etc.

## What is performance testing? 
Performance testing verifies loads, volumes, and response times, as defined by requirements. 

## What is load testing? 
Load testing is testing an application under heavy loads, such as the testing of a web site under a range of loads to determine at what point the system response time will degrade or fail. 

## What is stress testing? 
Stress testing is testing that investigates the behavior of software (and hardware) under extraordinary operating conditions. For example, when a web server is stress tested, testing aims to find out how many users can be on-line, at the same time, without crashing the server
